This is a helper routine for building CGI programs.  It buffers
stdout until you're completed building your output.  If you should
get an error before you are finished, then it will display a nice
error message (in HTML), log the error, and send email about the
problem.

To build/install it, use 

	perl Makefile.PL
	make 
	make install
